ppconvert supports conversion of pseudopotentials between different formats

ppconvert is currently not built automatically, but can be built on limited platforms
(Centos7, Ubuntu  with intel 17 or 18 as of now) it may work on other platforms. Clang and GCC support with MKL are planned.

cmake -DBUILD_PPCONVERT=1
and
make ppconvert

If it's broken on your platform ask a developer or post on google groups.
